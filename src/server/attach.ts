 * runs, one quiet for hours is finished and waits for your review. From then on it's PacedMind's like any other:
 * Resume reopens that very conversation with PacedMind's hooks and token (the launcher finds its folder in the agent's
 * own record on that computer, other-sessions.ts), and when its agent calls start_task or finish_task for the task
 * with your own connection, it reports on this session.
